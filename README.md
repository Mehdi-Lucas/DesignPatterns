# DesignPatterns

This repo contains projects used to explore and get practical knowledge about design patterns using Java. Those projects are part of "NFP121 - Programmation Avanc√©e" course I studied for my Bachelor of Computer Science.

To run the program it's advised to use BlueJ and start package.bluej contained in each directory.
